When SecurOS\n Auto operates, using a large number of License plate recognizers  with a high density of traffic flows, the\n volume of its main Database  (auto ) can reach significant sizes. With such a load on the Database , it\n requires regular maintenance.\n After maintenance, in some cases it is necessary to restart the single PostgreSQL service, which runs all\n databases located in a common cluster. Such a restart results in loss of communication with all active\n Operator Workstations of the network, which is an unacceptable operating condition for SecurOS. To\n avoid this situation, you need to allocate the auto  database int",

To edit databases in real-time mode with the help of the SecurOS Auto the\n Watchlists  tab (see\u00a0 Working with Watchlists Tab  section) is used.\n Besides that third-party databases can be used, SecurOS Auto provides accessing to the internal\n template-created lists (databases).

Elimination of distortion in the megapixel video can\n recognize numbers, visible under considerably large angles (horizontal and vertical) than allowed by\n regulations.\n Note. Distortion may be caused by applying low-quality optical camera devices or camera with big\n observation angle or short distance between the object and the Recognizer 's camera.\n Location: <SecurOS_root_folder>\\Modules\\Auto\\ccu.exe36\n www.issivs.comUser Guide SecurOS Auto\n Module Administration\n Figure 20.
