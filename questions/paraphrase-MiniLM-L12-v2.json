When SecurOS\n Auto operates, using a large number of License plate recognizers  with a high density of traffic flows, the\n volume of its main Database  (auto ) can reach significant sizes. With such a load on the Database , it\n requires regular maintenance.\n After maintenance, in some cases it is necessary to restart the single PostgreSQL service, which runs all\n databases located in a common cluster.
