Two sensitivity levels are\n available: Normal  and High . The latter is likely to produce better results\n in more difficult circumstances (e.g., low-contrast images, large view\n angles, etc.) at the cost of employing more computing and, thereby,\n increasing the processor load by roughly 30%.\n The High  level is recommended when the priority is to reduce the\n percent of completely missed license plates (with unrecognized plate\n numbers).

When SecurOS\n Auto operates, using a large number of License plate recognizers  with a high density of traffic flows, the\n volume of its main Database  (auto ) can reach significant sizes. With such a load on the Database , it\n requires regular maintenance.\n After maintenance, in some cases it is necessary to restart the single PostgreSQL service, which runs all\n databases located in a common cluster. Such a restart results in loss of communication with all active\n Operator Workstations of the network, which is an unacceptable operating condition for SecurOS.
